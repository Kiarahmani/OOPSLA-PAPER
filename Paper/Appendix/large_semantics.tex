Here, we explain our detailed operational semantics, to maintain
multi-consistent replicated stores. We assume a given function from
operation names, to consistency contracts: $\Psi :  op \mapsto \psi $
and for simplicity reasons (again, it can be easily generalized) we
consider contracts made by a single prop:
\begin{smathpar}
\Psi(op)=\forall (a,b). a \xrightarrow{R_{op}} \Rightarrow a \xrightarrow{vis} b. 
\end{smathpar}
For a given realtion $R$ we also define $R[m]$ to refer to the m'th
relation seed in $R$:
\begin{smathpar}
(r_1;r_2;...;r_m;...;r_k)[m] = r_m
\end{smathpar}
Each replica in this semantics, maintains a $\Pool$ of available
effects, and a $\Cache$ of filtered effects for each operation, each of
which is a subset of $\Pool$ that is closed under its associated
contract, i.e. $\forall \eff \in \Cache(op). (\trunc{R_{op}})_{\Pool}^{-1}(\eff)
\subseteq \Cache(op) $ 
We also define $\Avail$ of effects 
which is  maintained according to section
\ref{sec:alg}.
Following is the formal definitions and the operation semantics.
