  Modern-day distributed systems often use replication to improve
  communication latency and fault tolerance among geographically
  distributed servers and clients.  But, replication comes at a steep
  cost in simplicity because it forces applications to weigh the
  correctness benefits of guaranteeing strong consistency against its
  potentially significant performance cost.  Because not all
  operations on a replicated data type require strongly consistent
  behavior, however, library designers should be able to ideally
  direct implementations to provide only the level of consistency
  required, eschewing the costs of strong consistency except when
  absolutely required.  Unfortunately, implementations typically
  support only a small set of consistency levels, placing the burden
  of defining new ones, when necessary, to applications.
  
  In this paper, we describe a lightweight runtime system for weakly
  consistent distributed systems that dynamically customizes a
  consistency protocol based on a declarative axiomatic specification,
  freeing developers from writing bespoke and complex consistency
  protocols not already provided.  The
  specification reflects necessary constraints that any correct
  implementation must satisfy.  Our technique generates a provably
  optimal enforcement mechanism that imposes no additional
  communication or blocking overhead beyond what is required to
  satisfy the specification, and works for any off-the-shelf key-value
  store.

  We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by automatically
  deriving enforcement mechanisms for various well-known weak
  consistency instantiations.  Experimental results show that the
  performance of our automatically derived mechanisms is comparable to
  specialized hand-written protocols, providing strong evidence of its
  practical utility.
