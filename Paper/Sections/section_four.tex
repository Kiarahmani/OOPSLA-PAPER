\section{Operational Semantics}

In this section we explain the core operational semantics of our
consistency enforcement algorithm. 
Our approach is complete for the specification language defined earlier,
and extends the key-value store to multiple different consistency
environments. Here for simplicity reasons, we present the semantics 
parametrized over a single contract,
however as we explain in section \ref{subsec:generalization}, it can be easily
generalized to cover all contracts and multiple consistency levels. In
the rest of this section we will assume a given contract $\psi$ of the
following form:
	\begin{smathpar}
	\begin{array}{lcc}
		\psi = \forall (a,b). a \xrightarrow{R} b  \Rightarrow a
		\xrightarrow{vis} b, & \spc & R=r_1;r_2;...;r_k \\
	\end{array}
	\end{smathpar}
