\subsection{Specification Language}
\label{subsec:spec_lang}
Following is the formal syntax of specification language in our system:
\input{Sections/syntax}
\\ The language is general enough to cover all  the known consistency
levels in the context:
\input{Figures/fig_contract_examples}
\\ Specifications written in our language, can be visualized by simple
graphs. For example, \texttt{(MR)} guarantee from the above figure can
be represented as:
\input{Figures/fig_contract_visualize}
