\section{Motivation}

Let's consider the developement of a web-based bulletin board application, where
users can write their messaeg on a board, or request to read the current
messages on it.
In order to make the application scalable and highly
available, developers implement it as a distributed application, working
with replicated data items, that runs on top of an off-the-shelf
eventually consistent data store.

This is good and fast.
%--- Consistency requirements
\subsection{Integrity Anomalies}
We now want to think about behaviour of the application. There are some
correctness properties that we should deal with. For example, each user
must be able to read her or his own messages, in the subsequent reads.
because it's stupid otherwise.
These guarantees are not offered in EC. for example,, figure.. 
alice writes and the reads and does not see her own tweet. 
%--- Ad hoc approach
\subsection{Ad-hoc consistency implementation}
there are methods to prevent the anomalies mentioned above. The
developers now must record all clients and their sequence numbers and at
each replica they should make sure the operation is blocked untill all
the required deps are present. 
This is as we are going to explain it is awful. 
Now after everything is done, we relize some other requirements and the
developer isnow screwd. 
% Our approach
\subsection{Multi-Consistent Extension}
Doing these messy things is unavoidable, since the underlying stores,
only offer eventual consistency or if we are locky, one or two more
(such as causal consistency and strong consistency). But developers are
not interested in unnecessary consistency guaranteees and do it
themselves. There are so many of consistency known requirements and
there aren't generic ways of implementing them.
We are now arguing that all the consistency stuff can be
completely separated from the application level. We are proposing a
method that would completely liberate the developers from thinking about
these awful stuff. We are offering a shim that simply extends the
keyvalue store and preserves a consistency guarantee by recording
