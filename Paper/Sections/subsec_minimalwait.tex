% THE MINIIMAL WAIT THEOREM
%

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:three}
For all execution states $E$, if there
exists ($S\subseteq E.A$) such that: 
\begin{smathpar}
\auxred{S} {(\E,op_{<s,i>})} {} {(\E',\eff)} \spc \wedge \spc (\mathtt{S \cup \{\eta\} \; is 
\;} \psi \mathtt{-consistent \; under \;} E' )  
\end{smathpar}
then there exist  $E''$, $\eff'$ and $V\subseteq E.A$ such that:
$((\E,op_{<s,i>})\;\xrightarrow{V}\;(\E'',\eff'))$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is given by choosing set $V$ to be equal to $S$, and then
considering two cases, where either $S$ or $\left \lfloor S \right
\rfloor_S$ are made visible to operations, if the contract is respectively
waiting and non-waiting. In both cases, all premises of taking an step
are satisfied.
A detailed proof can be found in appendix
\ref{app:proof3}.
