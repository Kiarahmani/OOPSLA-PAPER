%Subsection of the maximality of the set made visible and liveness
%properties

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:two}
For all operation executions of the form: 
$(\E,op_{<s,i>}) 
    \;\xrightarrow{V}\;
  (\E',\eff) 
,$
the set of effects made visible to $\eta$ is maximal. i.e. for all
execution states $\E''$ such that:
$(\E,op_{<s,i>})\;\xrightarrow{V}\;(\E'',\eff)$
then    
$\small (\E''.vis^{-1}(\eta)) \subseteq
(\E'.vis^{-1}(\eta))$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is directly followed by the fact that the subset of effects
made visible to each operation is either $V$ itself, or $\left \lfloor V
\right \rfloor_V$ which is by definition maximal. The detailed proof can be found in appendix
\ref{appendix:proofs} \\
\end{proof}
