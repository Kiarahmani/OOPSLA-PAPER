  Modern-day distributed systems often use replication to improve
  communication latency and fault tolerance among geographically
  distributed servers and clients.  But, replication comes at a steep
  cost in program reasoning that forces applications to weigh the
  reasoning benefits of guaranteeing strong consistency among replicas
  against its potentially significant performance cost.  Because not
  all operations on a replicated data type require strongly consistent
  behavior, however, library designers should be able to ideally
  direct implementations to provide precisely the level of consistency
  required, eschewing the costs of strong consistency except when
  absolutely required.

  In this paper, we describe a lightweight runtime system for weakly
  consistent distributed systems that dynamically customizes a
  consistency protocol based on a declarative axiomatic specification.
  The specification reflects necessary constraints that any correct
  implementation must satisfy.  Our technique generates a provably
  optimal enforcement mechanism that imposes no additional
  communication or blocking overhead beyond what is required to
  satisfy the specification, and works for any off-the-shelf key-value
  store.

  We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by automatically
  deriving enforcement mechanisms for various well-known weak
  consistency guarantees in the literature. Experimental results show
  that the performance of the automically derived mechanisms is
  comparable to specialized hand-written protocols, providing strong
  evidence of its practical utility.
