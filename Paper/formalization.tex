\section{Formalization}
In this section we first present our specification language and then
introduce the opeational semantics of our tool. The operational semantics of our tool is presented in two different sets. First set of rules, presents the core of our algorithm and we use it to present the proofs of correctness and optimality. 

\subsection{Specification Language}
Following is the formal syntax of specification language in our system:
\input{syntax}
\\ The language is general enough to cover all  the known consistency
levels in the context:
\input{fig_contract_examples}
\\ Specifications written in our language, can be visualized by simple graphs. For example, \texttt{(MR)} guarantee from the above figure can be represented as:
\input{fig_contract_visualize}
