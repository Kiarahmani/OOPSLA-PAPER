\section{Formalization}
In this chapter we first present our specification language and then
introduce the core opeational semantics of our tool.
\subsection{Specification Language}
Following is the formal syntax of contract language in our system:
\input{syntax}
\\ The language is general enough to cover all  the known consistency
levels in the context:
\input{fig_contract_examples}
\\ Contracts written in our language, can be visualized by simple graphs. For example, \texttt{(MR)} contract from the above figure can be represented as:

\input{fig_contract_visualize}

\newpage
\subsection{Core Operational Semantics}
Here we explain the the core operational semantics of our algorithm, which for simplicity reasons, 
is parametrized over a single contract 
$\psi = \forall (a,b). a \xrightarrow{r_1;r_2;r_3} b  \Rightarrow a \xrightarrow{vis} b$. 
We also omit the unnecessary notions of replicated stores and programs.
