\section{Formalization}
In this chapter we first present our specification language and then
introduce the core opeational semantics of our tool.
\subsection{Specification Language}
Following is the formal syntax of contract language in our system:
\input{syntax}
\\ The language is general enough to cover all  the known consistency
levels in the context:
\input{fig_contract_examples}
\\ Contracts written in our language, can be visualized by simple graphs. For example, \texttt{(MR)} contract from the above figure can be represented as:

\input{fig_contract_visualize}

\newpage
\subsection{Operational Semantics}
Our system is consisted of a number of replicas, each of which itself is consisted of an array of caches. Each cache is consistent according to a part of the contract:
\input{fig_replica_model}
\\ Here we explain the the core operational semantics of our algorithm, which for simplicity reasons, 
is parametrized over a single contract 
$\psi = \forall (a,b). a \xrightarrow{r_1;r_2;...;r_k} b  \Rightarrow a \xrightarrow{vis} b$. 
However this can be easily  genralized to maintain different levels of consistency.
