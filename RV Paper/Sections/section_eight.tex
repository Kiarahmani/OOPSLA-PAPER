%RDTs
Distributed data structures composed of operation-based replicated
data types (RDTs) \cite{rdt,crdt} have been utilized in a number of
real-world systems \cite{tango,cassandra}.  However, these systems are
developed without assuming any principled notions of consistency, and
thus have goals different from \tool.  Like \cite{bolton}, \tool's
focus is entirely on consistency management, and leaves issues of
liveness and durability management to the underlying data store.


%coordination
The specification of consistency requirements of replicated
data-objects have been studied in several works
\cite{autoc,mahsa,bloom}, where multiple sufficient conditions and
analysis techniques are proposed to detect potential coordination
points in programs to enforce different notions of consistency.  \tool
shares similar goals, manifested within a lightweight runtime
enforcement mechanism that dynamically validates fine-grained
consistency specifications.

%Consistency on top of EC
Numerous systems \cite{geofast,petersen,cbs,chapar,bolton,quelea}
define and implement various levels of consistency guarantees in order
to protect applications from anomalies admitted under EC.
\cite{chapar} presents a verified implementation for a causally
consistent store, assuming a system model with \emph{session
  stickiness}, where unlike \tool, operations from a session are
always routed to the same replica. The idea of a causally consistent
shim layer on top of an off-the-shelf ECDS, is proposed in
\cite{bolton} and is also utilized in \cite{quelea}, which offers
three coarse-grained levels of consistency.  \tool extends the shim
layer in \cite{quelea} by maintaining \emph{multiple} fine-grained
weak consistency levels.

%% % contract language
%% \tool's contract language shares similarity to \cite{rdt,rdtabs}, but
%% similar to \cite{quelea} is crafted for consistency
%% specification. Compared to \cite{quelea}, \tool introduces a more
%% strictly structured syntax (without losing any generality), allowing
%% the classification of consistency guarantees, which enables a generic
%% consistency enforcement method, whereas \cite{quelea} relies on an SMT
%% solver to \emph{map} the operations, to the weakest \emph{pre-defined}
%% consistency guarantee that satisfies the given contract.
