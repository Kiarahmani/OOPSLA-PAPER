% THE MINIIMAL WAIT THEOREM
%

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:three}
For all execution states $\E$, if there exists a set of effects
$S\subseteq \E.\EffSoup$, such that: 
\begin{fmathpar}
\auxred{S} {(\E,op_{<s,i>})} {} {(\E',\eff)} \spc \wedge \spc (\mathtt{S \cup \{\eta\} \; is 
\;} \psi \mathtt{-consistent \; under \;} E' )  
\end{fmathpar}
then there exist  $\E''$, $\eff'$ and $V$ such that:
$((\E,op_{<s,i>})\;\xrightarrow{V}\;(\E'',\eff'))$
\end{theorem}
A trivial corollary of the above theorem is the liveness of our operational
semantics, since at least one set $S$ with the requested
properties always exists\footnote{$S=\E.\EffSoup$. This requires the
preservation of $\psi$-consistency under the resuction step, that is
already shown in theorem 1.} at any execution state.
